# Maze Generation with Python!

This repository is a translation of the code from the book *Mazes for Programmers: Coding Your Own Twisty Little Passages* by Jamis Buck.

That code is originally written in Ruby, which is nice, but a bit niche. I decided to test my programming skills by translating it.

To view the mazes, either run `BinaryTree` or `Sidewinder` on a `Grid` object (they run in place). 

You can then either print out a Grid object to the console, or you can call the `toImage()` method of Grid, 
which will attempt to open the image in an image viewer, courtesy of `Pillow`.
